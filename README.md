# BackgroundSubtractorMOG
* It is a Gaussian Mixture-based Background/Foreground Segmentation Algorithm.
* An improved adaptive background mixture model for real-time tracking with shadow detection.
* It uses a method to model each background pixel by a mixture of K Gaussian distributions (K = 3 to 5).

# BackgroundSubtractorMOG2
* It is also a Gaussian Mixture-based Background/Foreground Segmentation Algorithm.
* Improved adaptive Gausian mixture model for background subtraction.
* Efficient Adaptive Density Estimation per Image Pixel for the Task of Background Subtraction.
* One important feature of this algorithm is that it selects the appropriate number of gaussian distribution for each pixel.

* Motion detction in Open CV works by substracting the background from the image.
* For this two function BackgroundSubtractorMOG2() and BackgroundSubtractorMOG() 
  either of themcan be used.
* This repository contains two scripts for motion detection.
* Anyone of them can be considered to detect the motion.
* But prefer MOG2() for background substraction , as it is enhanced than the other one.
* Since here I am using python version 3.5 for the execution, so some syntax statements may vary,
  but these has been listed further in comments.
